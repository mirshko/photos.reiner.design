# Jeff Reiner

I'm currently freelancing as a design engineer located in Berlin, as well as working on frontend at [Union](https://union.finance) and design at [Soapbox](https://soapbox.social).

I focus on engaging, responsive, mobile-first websites and apps; highly-usable and efficient design systems; and solving complex UX problems, in and around the Web 2.0 and Web3 space.

You can find me most active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mirshko) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mirshko), see what I'm building on [GitHub](https://github.com/mirshko), and for a more formal introduction or project request, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:jeff@reiner.design).

If you need one of those fancy things, [here's my r√©sume](/jeff-reiner.pdf).
